- Description (≤260 chars)
- Topics (3-5)
- First-comment (200-400 chars, in user's voice)
- Gallery captions (5 captions, ≤80 chars each)

### tweet
Produce a 5-9 tweet thread:
- Tweet 1: hook + key visual hint (≤250 chars, must work standalone)
- Tweets 2-N: each one specific outcome / feature, ≤250 chars
- Final tweet: CTA with link placeholder

### email
Produce:
- Subject line (≤50 chars, no emoji-spam)
- Preheader (≤90 chars)
- Body (≤80 words, one link, one CTA)

### community
Produce templates for:
- Hacker News Show HN post (title + body)
- Indie Hackers launch post (title + body)
- Reddit-relevant-sub post (title + body — flag NOT to spam multiple subs)
- 1-paragraph version for Discord / Slack drops

### press
Produce a press release / pitch:
- Subject line for outreach email (≤60 chars)
- 60-word email body (no attachment, link only)
- List of 5 specific outlets / newsletters / podcasters to target

Save the output as `docs/launch-assets/<channel>.md` (create the dir if it doesn't exist).

Output:

- Word/char counts vs limits
- One-line "ready to ship" or "needs <thing>"

No editorial commentary on the content — that's the marketer's job in-file.
