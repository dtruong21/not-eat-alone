# Changelog

All notable changes to {{PROJECT_NAME}} that affect users. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — see [`docs/VERSIONING.md`](docs/VERSIONING.md) for the bump policy.

**Rule:** Only user-visible changes go here. Internal refactors, dev tooling, test additions, codegen updates, and CI tweaks do NOT belong in this file. If a user couldn't notice the change, it doesn't get a line.

**Conventions for `[Unreleased]` entries** (drives `/bump` semantics — see [`docs/VERSIONING.md`](docs/VERSIONING.md)):

| Section | Used for | SemVer bump on cut |
|---|---|---|
| `### Added` | New user-facing capability | MINOR |
| `### Changed` | Visible behavior change in existing feature | PATCH (or MAJOR if "(BREAKING)") |
| `### Fixed` | Bug fix | PATCH |
| `### Deprecated` | Feature marked for removal in next major | MINOR |
| `### Removed` | Feature removed | MAJOR |
| `### Security` | User-visible security fix | PATCH |

`/bump` reads this file and decides the bump for you. Override with `/bump major` etc. when the heuristic is wrong.
