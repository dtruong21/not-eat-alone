# Principles

The standing rules and the role "hats." CLAUDE.md carries one-liners; this file is the full text. Read on demand — don't paste it into every session.

## 1. MVP-first — rule zero

**v1 ships the minimum viable subset that delivers the pillar outcomes — nothing more.** Polish, niceties, animations, "while we're at it" additions all wait for v1.1+.

When evaluating any feature (yours or the user's):

- Default verdict: **POST-MVP** or **CUT**. Make the case to get features INTO v1, not out of it.
- If a feature *might* be MVP-fit, ask: "Is there a smaller version that still delivers the pillar outcome?" Ship the smaller one.
- States that ship in v1: empty, loading, error, golden path. Animations, micro-interactions, edge polish: v1.1.
- This applies mid-build too. New scope appears → push back: "Is this v1 or v1.1?"

`/scope-check` biases hard toward CUT. Trust it.

## 2. UX is the top priority

UX wins every trade-off except MVP scope:

```
MVP scope  >  UX quality  >  feature breadth  >  code elegance  >  dev convenience
```

If MVP and UX conflict, **cut the feature** — don't ship a half-quality version. If UX conflicts with anything below it, UX wins.

- **States are first-class.** Empty, loading, error, offline ship with every feature — not "polish later."
- **Latency is UX.** Optimistic updates, no jank, taps respond in <100ms.
- **Accessibility is UX.** Dark-mode parity, screen-reader paths, dynamic type — v1, not v1.1.

## 3. Analytics is first-class

The tracking plan at `docs/TRACKING-PLAN.md` is the analytics PRD — every event the product fires lives there BEFORE the code is written. Add events with `/track <event>` (updates the doc AND `lib/analytics/events.ts`). Events carry no PII; the typed registry enforces this. Never call analytics SDKs directly — always `track()` from `lib/analytics/client.ts`.

## 4. QA gate

The QA process keeps the product shippable. **No release ships with open P0/P1 bugs.** Read `.claude/agents/qa-engineer.md` and `docs/TEST-PLAN.md` before every release. The regression test is the price of admission for a bug fix — no fix ships without one.

## 5. Security model

Firebase web config is **not secret**. Security comes from Firestore rules + Auth, not from hiding API keys. The real secrets: Firebase Admin service account, EAS signing keys, OAuth client secrets. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## 6. Output discipline (token-saving)

1. Delegate wide/throwaway work to the built-in Explore agent; keep routine work in the main loop.
2. No preambles ("Sure, I'll…"). Just do it and report.
3. No code dumps when a file path will do. "Wrote `lib/firebase/foo.ts`" beats pasting the file.
4. No end-of-turn recaps. The diff is the artifact.
5. Ask a cheap question before exploring widely.
6. `Read` known paths; `Grep`/`Glob` for symbols. Don't read whole folders.

## Role hats

These commands make you wear a hat. Each hat's operating rules:

Every hat also exists as an **opt-in sub-agent** in `.claude/agents/` (same rules, isolated context): `idea-validator`, `product-strategist`, `ux-designer`, `developer`, `qa-engineer`, `release-manager`, `marketer`. Default is the hat — spawn the agent only when the work is big enough to isolate (each agent file's description says when). Only `/test` and `/qa-sweep` spawn by default.

### Strategist (`/idea`, `/spec`, `/scope-check`)
Before any spec exists, `/idea` pressure-tests the raw business idea: problem, alternatives, wedge, monetization → **GO / PIVOT / KILL**. Most ideas should die there cheaply; on GO, draft `docs/PRD.md § Vision` + `§ Pillars` (max 3) and only then spec features. No `/spec` before a GO.

Keep v1 small. Turn fuzzy ideas into shippable scope. Write user stories as *As a [user], I want [capability] so that [outcome]* with 3–7 acceptance criteria including edge cases (empty, offline, error). Score every feature against the MVP pillars in `docs/PRD.md § Pillars`; reject what fits none. "Smallest version that works" beats "complete version that slips." Track scope in `docs/PRD.md`; open questions go to `§ Open questions` — resolve before implementation, never during.

### Designer (`/design`)
Read `docs/DESIGN.md` before every screen. Tokens, not magic values — new value means a new token first. Dark mode is first-class (every token has light + dark). Reuse `components/` before inventing. Motion is functional (Reanimated v3), not decoration. Hierarchy through typography before cards/borders. Design ALL states: empty, loading, error, offline, filled. Produce an SVG mockup via Artifact when the layout is non-obvious (390×844). Append the spec to `docs/DESIGN.md`.

### Engineer (`/build`, `/firestore`, `/hook`)
- **Firestore access is wrapped.** Every collection has `lib/firebase/<collection>.ts` exporting typed, zod-validated CRUD. Components never import `firebase/firestore`.
- **Routes are thin.** `app/` files compose feature components + read params. Logic lives in `features/<name>/`.
- **One hook per data dependency.** `useThings()`, `useThing(id)` — each wraps a TanStack Query call over a typed wrapper.
- **Tokens, no magic values.** From `lib/design/tokens.ts`.
- **TS strict, no `any`.** `unknown` + zod at Firestore boundaries — returns aren't trustworthy.
- **No premature abstraction.** Extract a shared component on the fourth similar screen, not the second.
- **Build order (non-negotiable):** data layer (`lib/firebase/…` + hook) → component → route.
- **Instrument analytics.** A user moment mapping to a metric in `docs/TRACKING-PLAN.md` fires its event (added via `/track` first). A feature ships with its events or it doesn't ship.
- **Perf defaults:** `FlatList` + `keyExtractor` for long lists (never `ScrollView`); memoize expensive renders; `expo-image` with `cachePolicy="memory-disk"`; clean up Firestore listeners in `useEffect` returns.

Firestore wrapper shape:
```ts
// lib/firebase/<collection>.ts
export const <Name>Schema = z.object({ ... });
export type <Name> = z.infer<typeof <Name>Schema>;
export const <name>Path = (...args) => `...`;
export async function get<Name>(id): Promise<<Name>> { ... }
export async function list<Name>s(parent?): Promise<<Name>[]> { ... }
export async function create<Name>(data): Promise<string> { ... }
export async function update<Name>(id, patch): Promise<void> { ... }
export async function delete<Name>(id): Promise<void> { ... }
```
Parse every doc through zod before returning; throw on parse failure with a clear message.

### Release (`/release`, `/bump`)
Full policy: `docs/RELEASE.md` + `docs/VERSIONING.md`. Marketing version in `app.json` `expo.version` (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Build number in `expo.ios.buildNumber` AND `expo.android.versionCode` — same integer, monotonic, never resets, never reused. `/bump` reads `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]`: any `### Added` → MINOR; else `### Changed`/`### Fixed`/`### Security` → PATCH; else `### Removed`/`(BREAKING)` → MAJOR. Run the release checklist in `docs/RELEASE.md`; if any check fails, STOP and report. Changelog is user-visible changes only — never internal refactors. Rollback a production P0 by cutting a hotfix off the last good tag (don't unpublish).

### Marketer (`/aso`, `/launch`)
Read `docs/PRD.md § Vision` and `docs/DESIGN.md` first — marketing voice = product voice. One claim per sentence. No jargon ("powerful/seamless/intuitive" add nothing). Concrete beats abstract ("Track 5 habits in 30 seconds"). Honesty beats hype — market only shipped (`Status: in-MVP`) features. Store metadata follows `docs/STORE_METADATA.md`; launch assets follow `docs/LAUNCH.md`. Don't launch to a cold list — T-4w groundwork is non-negotiable.
